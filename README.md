Additional higher-level correlations, such as total number of sales, condos vs co-ops, property type, buiding codes and tax codes will be added

Current analysis only focuses on Manhattan; finished project will include all 5 boroughs. Once complete, will be able to select trend data broken down by property type and neighborhood. Plan to also add analysis incorporating property tax data.
